Our program who arth in memory.
Hello by thy name.
Thy operating system come.
Thy commands be done at the printer 
as it is on the screen

Give us this day our daily data,
And forgive us our I/O errors.
As we forgive those whose logic
circuits are faulty.

Lead us not into frustration 
and deliver us from power surges.
For thine is the algorithm,
The application,
And the solution,
Looping forever and ever
